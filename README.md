# Content Scraper
## FullStack Tech Degree Project 6

### Node.js, JavaScript

#### Getting Started
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
- Create a scraper.js file that will contain your command line application.
- Program your scraper so that it visits the website http://shirts4mike.com and uses http://shirts4mike.com/shirts.php as single entry point to scrape information for 8 tee-shirts from the site
- The scraper should get the price, title, url and image url from the product page and save this information into a CSV file
- If http://shirts4mike.com is down, an error message describing the issue should appear in the console
- When an error occurs, log it to a file named scraper-error.log
